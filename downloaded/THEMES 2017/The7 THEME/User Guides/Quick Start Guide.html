			<section id="before" class="group">
				<h2>Before Getting Started</h2>

				<p>Due to the amount of features, settings and options available in The7, at first you may find it to be a bit overwhelming (compared to a usual "blog" theme).</p>

				<p>For super-easy adaptation, we recommend using <a href="#wizard">Theme Options Wizard</a> and avoid advanced settings. Very soon you will get the idea behind the theme architecture and will be able to use The7 to its full potential.</p>

				<p>Also note, that this Quick Start Guide does not cover basic WordPress usage. If you are a WordPress newbie, please get accustomed with it before proceeding with this manual and the theme!</p>

				<p>Here are some links that will help you to become more confident with WordPress:</p>

				<h2>Theme Installation</h2>
				<p>Before proceeding, please make sure that following plugins are not installed or deactivated:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WP-pagenavi;</li>
					<li>WP-less;</li>
					<li>Options Framework;</li>
					<li>any plugin that uses <strong>tgmpa</strong> (TGM Plugin Activation) and <strong>lessc</strong> (lessPHP) classes.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you've downloaded and unzipped the full theme package, locate the theme installation file called "dt-the7_v.X.X.X.zip" (where "X.X.X" is the theme version).</p>
				<p>Alternatively you can download the installable WordPress file from "Downloads" tab of your ThemeForest account (fig. 1):</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/download.png" alt="Downloading installable file">
					<figcaption>Fig. 1 - Downloading installable file.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><p>Don't forget to download the "License certificate &amp; purchase code" file. You will need the <strong>purchase code</strong> later to activate the theme.</p></div>

				<div id="admin" class="subgroup">
					<h3>Uploading theme via WordPress admin panel</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Log in to the WordPress admin area.</li>
						<li>Navigate to <strong>Appearance > Themes</strong>.</li>
						<li>Select the "Add New" (fig. 2.1):
							<figure>
								<img src="assets/images/upload_1.jpg" alt="Uploading theme">
								<figcaption>Fig. 2.1 - Uploading theme.</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</li>
						<li>Use the "Upload" button to upload the installable "dt-the7_v.X.X.X.zip" file, that you have previously downloaded to your computer (fig. 2.2):
							<figure>
								<img src="assets/images/upload_2.jpg" alt="Uploading theme">
								<figcaption>Fig. 2.2 - Uploading theme.</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</li>
						<li>Follow the instructions below to activate the theme.</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
						<p><strong>If you were not able to install the theme</strong> this way, most probably your server has upload file size limit. The theme installable .zip file is too large to be uploaded via WordPress admin area. You can contact your hosting provider and ask to ease this limit (e.g 16 MB will do).</p>
						<p>Alternatively you can read on to learn how to install the theme manually.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div id="cpanel" class="subgroup">
					<h3>Uploading theme via cPanel</h3>
					<p>If your host offers the cPanel control panel, follow these instructions:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>In cPanel File Manager, navigate to your "themes" folder. If your WordPress is installed in the document root folder of your web server you would navigate to "public_html/wp-content/themes" and if you have WordPress installed in a sub-folder called "wordpress", you would navigate to "public_html/wordpress/wp-content/themes".</li>
						<li>Once you've navigated to the "themes" folder in cPanel File Manager, click on Upload file(s) and upload the installable .zip file.</li>
						<li>Once the .zip file is uploaded, click on it in cPanel, then in the panel to the right, click on "Extract File Contents", and that .zip file will be uncompressed.</li>
						<li>Follow the instructions below to activate the theme.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<div id="ftp" class="subgroup">
					<h3>Uploading theme via FTP</h3>
					<p>To add a theme via FTP, follow these basic steps:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Unzip the installable file. You need to preserve the directory structure in the archive when unzipping it.</li>
						<li>Using an FTP client to access your host web server, upload the theme folder ("dt-the7") via FTP into "wp-content/themes/" folder.</li>
						<li>Follow the instructions below to activate the theme.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<div id="activate" class="subgroup">
					<h3>Activate the theme</h3>
					<p>To activate The7:</p>

						<img src="assets/images/cannot-upload.png" alt="Cannot upload the theme">
						<figcaption>Fig. 4 - Cannot upload the theme.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>If you were not able to install the theme via "Appearance > Themes" interface (see fig. 4 above), most probably your server has upload file size limit. The theme installable .zip file is too large to be uploaded via WordPress admin area. You can contact your hosting provider and ask to ease this limit (e.g 16 MB will do) or install the theme <a href="#cpanel">manually</a>.</p>
				</div>

						<img src="assets/images/missing.png" alt="Theme is missing the style.css stylesheet">
						<figcaption>Fig. 5 - Theme is missing the style.css stylesheet.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>A common issue that can occur with users new to installing WordPress themes is a "Broken theme and/or stylesheets missing" error message being displayed when trying to upload or activate the theme. This error message does not mean that the theme is broken, it simply means that you are uploading the wrong file.</p>
					<p>Please make sure that file you are uploading the installable file. It is called something like "dt-the7_v.X.X.X.zip". Please refer to <a href="#theme">this</a> section of guide for details.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="blank" class="subgroup">
					<h3>Blank page / allowed memory size error after The7 activation</h3>
					<p>Blank page on theme preview or after theme activation, in most cases, is the indication of the so-called <strong>memory limit issue</strong>. It's the same issue when you're getting the "Allowed memory size of xxxxxxxx bytes exhausted" error. Here's how to solve it:</p>
					<p>First and foremost, try to edit the "wp-config.php" file in the root of you WordPress installation. Search for <code>'WP_MEMORY_LIMIT'</code>. If there is such setting, set the limit to <code>'256MB'</code>. If there's no such setting, add this bit of code before the MySQL settings <code>define( 'WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M' );</code>. Also make sure there's no <code>'WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT'</code> setting in "wp-config.php" file; or make sure it is not less then <code>'256MB'</code>.</p>
					<p>Second, if editing "wp-config.php" did not help, try to add this bit of code in the beginning of ".htaccess" file: <code>php_value memory_limit 256M</code>.</p>
					<p>Third, if you get the error even after completing both steps above, it may be that your PHP is configured in CGI or suPHP. In this case instead of ".htaccess", you should create a file called "php.ini" and place this bit of code in it: <code>memory_limit = 256M</code>.</p>
					<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><p>If above steps did not yield any result, please don't hesitate to contact your hosting company support department. Since this is most likely a server-related problem, we will not be able to help you.</p></div>
				</div>

				<div id="chmod" class="subgroup">
					<h3>Failed to create customization .CSS file</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="assets/images/chmod.png" alt="CHMOD issue">
						<figcaption>Fig. 6 - CHMOD issue.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Theme will work fine on the vast majority of correctly installed and configured WordPress sites without any additional setup. However on some (very rear) hosting configurations you can notice that images on your site are not uploading/displaying or theme returns notifications about setting certain CHMOD rules on "uploads" folder (see fig. 6 above). If you are experiencing this issue, please follow these steps to fix it:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Make sure that theme installed strictly to "your_site/wp-content/themes/" folder.</li>
						<li>The folder "your_site/wp-content/uploads" must be created. On some servers you'll need to set its CHMOD to 755, on others – to 777.</li>
						<li>Please check the upload path is set to default (in Settings > Media or in wp-config.php).</li>
					</ol>

					<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><p>If above steps did not yield any result, please don't hesitate to contact your hosting company support department. Since this is most likely a server-related problem, we will not be able to help you.</p></div>
				</div>

				<div id="404" class="subgroup">
					<h3>404 error on some pages</h3>
					<p>After theme activation, on some pages you can encounter the "404 Page not found" error. This is a simple one. In WordPress admin area, navigate to <strong>Settings > Permalinks</strong> and click the "Save Changes" button. This will update the ".htaccess" file to work with custom post types of The7 correctly.</p>

				<h2>Theme Registration</h2>

				<p>Note that in case you want to use your purchase code on other domain name (e.g. when you are moving a site from one domain to another) you'll need to de-register the theme first (fig. 7.2):</p>

			<section id="demo" class="group">
				<h2>Pre-made Websites</h2>
				<p>You can import pre-made websites (also called "demo websites", "demo content" or just "demos") via <strong>The7 > Pre-made Websites</strong> interface.
